		<strong>
			Can I cancel an order once I have placed it?
		</strong>

			Yes – but only till the restaurant has accepted it. Once they start working on the order, we don’t think it’s fair to allow cancellation. You can however request the outlet and if they’re ok, the order can be cancelled.

			 I ordered on Twyst but I didn’t get any cashback why?
		</strong> 
		<p>
			The only case where you don’t get Cashback for ordering via Twyst is when you apply a food voucher to order on Twyst. You cannot GET Twyst Bucks and USE Twyst Bucks on the same order – but hey, you did save when you applied the offer J. If you didn’t apply an offer to your order but still didn’t get any Twyst Bucks then please write to us and we’ll look into it.

			 Do Twyst Bucks expire?
		</strong> 
		<p>
			Short answer - Yes. Twyst Bucks are valid for a period of 6 months from when they are earned. The Twyst Bucks that you earn earlier will be used earlier every time you redeem, so you shouldn’t have to worry about expiry, but in case you do have expiring Twyst Bucks we’ll notify you well in advance.
